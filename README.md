# Image Color Detector

This Color Detector reads the input image and detects the colours in it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- NumPy library
- scikit-learn library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-color-detector.git
   
2. Change to the project directory:
   
   bash
   cd image-color-detector

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Place your image file in the project directory.
 
2. Open color_detector.py and modify the image_path and num_colors variables:
   image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
   num_colors = 5
   
3. Run the script:
   bash
   python color_detector.py
   
4. The script will print the RGB values of the detected dominant colors.
